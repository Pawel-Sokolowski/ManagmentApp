# Fix for NSIS Build Error - Summary

## Problem
The Windows installer build was failing with:
```
warning 6029: Name: specified multiple times, wasting space (common.nsh:14)
Error: warning treated as error
```

## Root Cause
The custom NSIS script `installer-resources/installer.nsh` contained directives that electron-builder sets automatically:
- `Name "Office Management System"` - Conflicted with electron-builder's auto-generated Name directive
- `OutFile`, `InstallDir`, `RequestExecutionLevel` - Also duplicated
- Main `Section "Install"` - Conflicted with electron-builder's install section

When electron-builder includes a custom NSIS script via the `include` option, it merges it with its own generated script. Any duplicate directives cause NSIS warnings, which are treated as errors.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Removed Conflicting Directives
Removed these lines from `installer-resources/installer.nsh`:
- `Name "Office Management System"`
- `OutFile "Office-Management-System-Setup.exe"`
- `InstallDir "$PROGRAMFILES\Office Management System"`
- `RequestExecutionLevel admin`
- `!define MUI_ABORTWARNING`
- `!define MUI_ICON` and `!define MUI_UNICON`

### 2. Converted Sections to Macros
- Changed `Section "Install"` to `!macro customInstall`
- Changed `Section "Uninstall"` to `!macro customUnInstall`
- Removed file copying, shortcut creation, and registry operations (electron-builder handles these)

### 3. Kept Custom Functionality
The script still provides:
- Custom installation type selection page (Desktop vs Server)
- `.env` file creation based on installation type
- PostgreSQL installation check
- Custom post-installation information page

### 4. Added Documentation
- Created `installer-resources/README.md` with detailed explanation
- Added inline comments to prevent future issues
- Documented electron-builder integration patterns

## Files Changed

1. **installer-resources/installer.nsh**
   - Removed 57 lines of conflicting configuration
   - Added 11 lines of proper electron-builder integration
   - Net change: -46 lines, cleaner integration

2. **installer-resources/README.md** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Reference links

## How to Verify the Fix

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Actions** tab
3. Select **Build Windows Executable** workflow
4. Click **Run workflow**
5. Wait for the build to complete
6. Download and test the installer from artifacts

### Method 2: Local Build (Windows only)
```bash
npm install
npm run dist-win
```

The build should complete without the "Name: specified multiple times" error.

## Expected Build Output
```
✓ built in 10.70s
• electron-builder  version=26.0.12 os=10.0.26100
• loaded configuration  file=package.json ("build" field)
• packaging       platform=win32 arch=x64 electron=38.1.2
• building        target=nsis file=dist-electron\Office Management System Setup 1.0.0.exe
✓ Built successfully
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] React build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [x] Documentation added
- [x] Code changes committed
- [ ] Windows installer builds successfully (requires Windows/GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Custom installation pages appear during installation
- [ ] Desktop/Server installation types work correctly
- [ ] .env file is created with correct configuration
- [ ] PostgreSQL check functions as expected
- [ ] Application runs after installation

## Additional Notes

### Why This Approach?
electron-builder provides specific hooks for customization:
- `!macro customInstall` - Runs after files are copied
- `!macro customUnInstall` - Runs during uninstallation
- Custom Pages - Can be added via `Page custom` directive

This approach avoids conflicts while maintaining all custom functionality.

### Preventing Future Issues
1. Never add `Name`, `OutFile`, `InstallDir`, or `RequestExecutionLevel` to custom NSIS scripts
2. Use macros (`!macro customInstall`) instead of Sections (`Section "Install"`)
3. Let electron-builder handle file copying, shortcuts, and registry entries
4. Test builds in GitHub Actions before merging
