## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### "Do I need to install PostgreSQL first?"
**No.** The installer downloads and installs it automatically.

### "Do I need to run any scripts or batch files?"
**No.** Everything happens during installation automatically.

### "What about setup-database.bat or one-click-setup.bat?"
**You don't need them.** The installer runs them automatically. They're included only for advanced troubleshooting.

### "Is there an MSI installer?"
The .exe installer is equivalent to MSI and works on all Windows systems. For silent enterprise deployment: `"Office Management System Setup.exe" /S`

### "What if I already have PostgreSQL?"
The installer detects existing PostgreSQL and uses it automatically.

### "Can I use this on both desktop and server?"
**Yes.** Same installer works for both scenarios.

### "What if installation fails?"
