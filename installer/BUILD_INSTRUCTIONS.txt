# INSTALLER FILE LOCATION

The Windows installer executable should be placed in this folder.

## To Build the Installer:

On a Windows machine with Node.js installed:

```bash
cd /path/to/ManagmentApp
npm install
npm run dist-win
```

Then copy the generated installer:
```bash
copy dist-electron\Office-Management-System-Setup-*.exe installer\Office-Management-System-Setup.exe
```

## Why isn't the installer here?

The installer is a compiled Windows executable that must be built on Windows or with Wine.
This repository was cleaned up to simplify documentation and remove scripts.
The installer can be built using the instructions above.
